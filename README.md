# Final-Project-GD50
Wizards of GD50

This is my final project during my time at Harvard Summer School in 2018 (as a sophomore in High School). It is a top-down Hack N Slash game about a Code Wizard who must 
travel through various randomly generated levels and defeat bugs. There are 3 different types of bugs that need to be taken care of, and each one requires a 
different "spell" to fix them. These can be changed by pressing Q and E. Each spell has its own levels, and upgrading the spells will make them stronger. You can
upgrade each spell as you complete more levels.
